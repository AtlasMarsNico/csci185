    <h1>Atlas's Newletter</h1>
    <h2>January 31</h2>
    <p><s>(This does not actually become a newsletter. Atlas doesn't have that knowledge yet)</s></p> <br>
    <p>Welcome to the first newsletter. Today is January 31st. I am, at the moment, sitting in my programming class. I got an email about a New Media art show. I will hopefully be in it but that depends on if I am able to do a piece of art I enjoy.
        A video game I enjoy has finally updated and it makes me so happy. I am going to try and post art on all of these Newletters. Sorry for it being so short. See you net newsletter!

    <h2>Feburary 2</h2>
    <p>I made one piece of art so far for the art show. I am also now technically a New Media student. I was having trouble picking my minor(s). At first I chose to do drama and art but then decided that I wanted to do anthropology. Here is the art so far.</p>
